Our documentation is [open-source](https://github.com/thewca/web-dev-docs)! You can submit corrections or add documentation - but open an issue to discuss larger contributions first.

## About

The [World Cube Association](https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/) ("WCA") governs twisty puzzle (think: Rubik's Cube) competitions around the world. There are a number of software resources which enable it to do this.

The code for these websites is open-source and any contributors are welcome to submit PR's. The [WCA Software Team](https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/teams-committees#WST) ("WST") is responsible for maintaining and driving development on WCA's software. See below for a list of software being developed.
