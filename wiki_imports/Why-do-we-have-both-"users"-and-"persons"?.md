If you look at our [database schema](https://github.com/thewca/worldcubeassociation.org/blob/master/WcaOnRails/db/structure.sql), you'll notice that there are 2 tables: one for "users", and one for "persons". The persons table has existed since the start of the WCA, it tracks everyone who has competed. If you have competed, you will have an entry in the persons table. We introduced the users table in early 2015 when the Rails port began. Users are people who have created an account on the website*. As part of creating an account on the website, users are asked if they have competed before, and if they have, they are prompted to claim a WCA ID. They have to enter their birthday and it must match the birthday in the persons table for them to make this claim. Furthermore, this claim must be approved by a WCA delegate of their choice. After approval, their user will have a `wca_id` field.


*With the notable exception of some "dummy accounts" we created to keep profile pictures working. These dummy accounts have been a continuous source of pain, and we will probably get rid of them someday.
