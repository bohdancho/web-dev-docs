The WCA Software Team (WST) is recruiting! We have a *ton* of work to do. The more help we can get, the better.

All our work is open sourced, so you do not have to be a member of the WST to contribute. If you feel confident enough to just start sending in pull requests, then please do so! If you're looking for inspiration, take a look at our list of [issues](https://github.com/thewca/worldcubeassociation.org/issues). If you decide to work on an issue, please add a comment before you get started so we know someone is working on it (it's shame if 2 people end up doing the same work).

If you're a programmer but don't have much experience with Ruby on Rails or GitHub, or just want to talk to a human about our codebase, then we like to schedule pair programming sessions. In these sessions, we'll explain our codebase a bit, and then we'll work together on one of our 1st mentored projects (see the [good first issue label](https://github.com/thewca/worldcubeassociation.org/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22META%3A+good+first+issue%22)). If you're interested in scheduling one of these, please send an email to the WCA Software Team. That email address is intentionally not included here as a first challenge for you =) Ideally, a "good first issue" project will let you add a simple feature or fix a bug, and write a test for it. The programming involved should be almost trivial, they're meant to be a way to learn our tools and infrastructure. After your first mentored project, we have [good second issue projects](https://github.com/thewca/worldcubeassociation.org/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22META%3A+good+second+issue%22). These might not be fully speced out and could take a few days/weeks.

After you've done some good work and proven that you aren't going to disappear, expect an invitation to the software team =)
