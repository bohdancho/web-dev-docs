## Do you have an API?

We don't have an officially-supported API. If you want to read data, we recommend the [unofficial API](https://wca-rest-api.robiningelbrecht.be/). If you want to OAuth or write data with the website, refer to [this article](https://docs.worldcubeassociation.org/knowledge_base/v0_api.html).

## How can I translate the website?

We have a guide for translators [here](https://docs.worldcubeassociation.org/guides/translating_the_website.html).

## Can I join WST?

Currently (2023-09-10) WST is not accepting new members. We aim to onboard more volunteers by early 2024.
